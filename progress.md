# ✅ Agentic AI Job Search Assistant — Progress Report (Up to Step 7)

## 🧩 Project Summary

The Agentic AI Job Search Assistant is a fully autonomous pipeline designed to:

* Scrape freelance jobs (e.g., from Upwork)
* Score and rank them
* Generate proposals
* Log memory of job interactions (both JSON and CSV)
* Use CrewAI agents to automate the job search process end-to-end

---

## 🧱 Current Progress (Step-by-Step)

### ✅ Step 1: Job Scraping (Mock / Live)

* Function: `run_scraper()`
* Input: Keyword query (e.g., "LangChain, Make.com, automation")
* Output: `job_data.csv` saved with jobs

### ✅ Step 2: FAISS Indexing

* Script: `faiss_index_builder.py`
* Action: Builds semantic search index
* Output: `faiss_index.idx` and `job_metadata.pkl`

### ✅ Step 3: Hybrid Job Search

* Script: `search_jobs_ranked.py`
* Logic: FAISS semantic + keyword match scoring
* Output: Ranked job list (used by agents)

### ✅ Step 4–7: Autonomous Agent Loop (via `run_pipeline.py`)

* Integrated CrewAI with 4 agents:

  * `ScoutAgent` → job discovery
  * `EvaluatorAgent` → job scoring + logging
  * `WriterAgent` → proposal drafting
  * `MemoryAgent` → stores result to JSON + CSV
* Intelligent memory logic:

  * ✅ JSON deduplication by `job_url`, `score`, and `proposal`
  * ✅ Skips incomplete or invalid job entries
* Output:

  * `memory/memory_log.json` ✅
  * `memory/memory_log.csv` ✅ *(minor formatting pending cleanup)*

---

## 📁 Files Finalized

* `tools.py` ✅ Final version with smart memory logic
* `agents.py` ✅ Integrated and working
* `run_pipeline.py` ✅ Orchestrator for Steps 1–7
* `.env` ✅ API key correctly loaded with `load_dotenv()`

---

## 📌 Pending (Optional)

* [ ] Clean malformed headers in `memory_log.csv`
* [ ] Add Slack/email notifications for saved jobs (if desired)
* [ ] Deployment automation (Step 8)

## 💤 Status

**All core logic tested, validated, and functioning autonomously.**
